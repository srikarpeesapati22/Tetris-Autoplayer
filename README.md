# Tetris-Autoplayer

The player files are two different ways used to make a tetris autoplayer.
Player-logic simply tries to play tetris by placing blocks in such a way that no holes are created.
Player-genetic uses a genetic algorithm to identify the best possible move to get the highest possible score.
